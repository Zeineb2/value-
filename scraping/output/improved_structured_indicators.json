The currencies identified in the COFER dataset are: U.S. dollar, Pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Chinese renminbi, and Euro.  All other currencies are included in the category of “other currencies.”  Prior to the introduction of the Euro in 1999, several European currencies were separately identified in COFER: European Currency Unit, Deutsche mark, French franc, and the Netherlands guilder. | COFER data are reported to the IMF on a voluntary and confidential basis by central banks from over 140 economies. COFER data for individual countries are strictly confidential. At present there are 149 reporters, consisting of the monetary authorities of IMF member countries and non-IMF member countries/economies; and of other foreign exchange reserves holding entities. COFER includes a list of the participating economies that agreed to disclose their names. SDDS Plus adherents are required to participate in the COFER database and to disclose their participation. The data published on this website are aggregates for each currency for the world, advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies. Starting 2015Q2, the IMF decided to cease the publication of the latter two geographical breakdowns to avoid possible residual disclosure of individual data with the release of the list of countries who have agreed to publish their names as COFER reporters.
