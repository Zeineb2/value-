The World Bank in Tunisia
The World Bank in Tunisia is supporting sustainable growth for the people of Tunisia, energy transition, water management, human capital development & social resilience, and quality jobs.
Overview
Since the sharp COVID-19 contraction in 2020 (-9%), Tunisia’s growth has remained moderate. After a rebound in 2021 (4.3%) and 2022 (2.7%), growth was 0% in 2023 and reached 1.4% in 2024. Recovery has been shaped by drought, global financing uncertainty, and subdued demand.
On the external front, Tunisia saw positive developments in 2024. Tourism revenues rose by 8.3% and remittances by 11.2%, helping to offset a 7.5% rise in the merchandise trade deficit. As a result, the current account deficit narrowed from 2.3% to 1.7% of GDP.
While the fiscal deficit eased to 6.3% of GDP in 2024, it remains higher than the 2019 level (2.9%). Public debt rose from 67.8% of GDP in 2019 to 81.2% in 2024, with gross financing needs increasing from 7.9% to 16.0%, largely due to debt amortization.
Although FDI increased by 4.4% in 2024, it covered a fifth of the combined current account and public external debt obligations. Authorities relied more on domestic sources, including a TND 7 billion (US$2.3 billion) Central Bank loan in 2024 and 2025, covering about a quarter of 2024’s needs.
Inflation has moderated, falling from 10.4% in February 2023 to 5.9% in March 2025, supported by easing global prices, lower demand, and a high policy rate. Nonetheless, it remains slightly above the pre-COVID average (5.3%), with food inflation at 7.8%, affecting lower-income households the most.
The unemployment rate rose slightly to 16% in Q3 2024 (from 15.8% in 2023), while labor force participation remains about 1.2 percentage points below pre-COVID levels.

The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Tunisia for FY2023–2027 lays out the World Bank's strategy in the country since June 2023. This CPF aligns with Tunisia's national and sectorial strategies. Informed by the
Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) and the
Country Climate and Development Report
(CCDR), the CPF aims to transition Tunisia to faster and more inclusive growth through three high-level outcomes:
The World Bank in Tunisia is supporting the Government in advancing these goals through multiple programs, with an immediate focus on Energy, Water, Human Capital and perspectives on Connectivity. Furthermore, the CPF aims to integrate two cross-cutting themes —gender and social accountability, participation, and trust — across programs. In addition to lending, the CPF lays out an ambitious agenda for advisory work and technical assistance.
The CCDR, launched in November 2023, provides a wide range of measures to tackle substantial climate challenges, encompassing water scarcity, rising sea levels, floods, and reliance on fossil fuel imports. The CCDR, aligned with national climate transition strategies, aims to mitigate climate impact while fostering economic recovery and employment opportunities by providing actionable recommendations for adaptation and decarbonization.
