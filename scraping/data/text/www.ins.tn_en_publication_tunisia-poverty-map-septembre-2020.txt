This poverty map report has been produced by the National Office of Statistics of Tunisia, in collaboration with the World Bank.
This poverty map report has been produced by the National Office of Statistics of Tunisia, in collaboration with the World Bank. The poverty indicators presented in this report were calculated on the basis of data from the General Census of Population and Housing (RGPH) of 2014 and the National Survey on Budget, Consumption and Living Standards of households (ENBCNV 2015). The calculation methodology, developed by C. Elbers, J. Lanjouw and P. Lanjouw (ELL 2000), makes it possible to estimate poverty and inequalities linked to consumption at fairly fine levels of disaggregation, by combining information from censuses and surveys on household consumption.
The report presents the poverty rate in the 264 Tunisian delegations. A brief analysis of the main economic and social realities at delegation level is presented for a more detailed understanding of the specifics of each geographic area analyzed.
