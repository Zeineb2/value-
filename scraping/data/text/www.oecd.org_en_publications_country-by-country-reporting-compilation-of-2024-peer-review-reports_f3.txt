Appropriate use of CbC reports
Tunisia is a non-reciprocal jurisdiction and, as such, will not receive CbC reports submitted to tax authorities in other jurisdictions. It is therefore not necessary for this peer review evaluation to reach any conclusions with respect to Tunisia’s compliance with the terms of reference on appropriate use.
